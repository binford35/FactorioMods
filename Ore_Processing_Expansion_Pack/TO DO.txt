Items:

[] - New building: Ore Crusher
[x]		item entry
		Description: Takes in raw ores (iron and copper) and crushes them into smaller particles of ore. One ore should produce two piles of crushed ore.
[x]		Recipe: Iron plates (for structure), steel plates (for crushers), iron gears (for the crusher motion), circuits (for the electronics)

[x] - New item(ore): Crushed Iron Ore
		Description: Iron ore that has been processed through the Ore Crusher. Will yield one iron plate in a furnace.
		
[x] - New item(ore): Crushed Copper Ore
		Description: Copper ore that has been processed through the Ore Crusher. Will yield one copper plate in a furnace.
		
[] - New building: Ore Milling Machine
[x]		item entry
		Description: Crushed ore or coke is fed into this machine to reduce it into piles of unrefined ore dust (copper or iron) or Coke Dust which can be further processed. This ore dust cannot be smelted. Produces 2 dust per crushed ore pile. 
[x]		Recipe: stone (for the milling stones), iron plates (for structure), iron gears (for milling wheels), transport belts (to convey the material), advanced circuits (for electronics)

[x] - New item (ore): Iron Ore Dust
		Description: Iron ore that has been processed through the Ore Milling Machine
		
[x] - New item (ore): Copper Ore Dust
		Description: Copper Ore that has been processed through the Ore Milling Machine
		
[] - New building: Froth Flotation Plant
[]		item entry
		Description: Copper Ore Dust and Water are fed into this plant which uses the froth flotation method to further refinement of Copper. The result of this is Refined Copper Ore Dust. For each Copper or Dust, two Refined Copper Ore Dust are created.
[]		Recipe: tanks (for the water and slurry storage), pipes (for routing water and slurry), furnace (for the dewatering of the ore mixtures), transport belts(to move materials), steel (for structure), advanced circuits (for electronics)
	
[x] - New item (ore): Refined Copper Ore Dust
		Description: Can be sent to furnace to smelt into Copper Plates.

[] - New building: Coke Oven
[]		item entry
		Description: Burns coal to produce coke.
[]		Recipe: iron plates (for furnace), circuits (for electronics), pipes (for pumping out air)

[x] - New item: Coke
		Description: Used in the process of iron refining
		
[x] - New item: Coke Dust
		Description: Used in the Blast Furnace to create iron ore. Made by running coke through the Ore Milling Machine. One Coke will produce two Coke Dust.

[] - New building: Blast Furnace
[]		item entry
		Description: Coke Dust and Iron Ore Dust are fed into this furnace and will produce Iron Plates or Pig Iron Pellets. One Coke Dust and One Iron Dust produce one Iron Plate or Pig Iron Pellets.
[]		Recipe: Stone Brick (for the furnace lining), Pipe (to transport the ore mixture to the furnace), steel furnace (for the furnace), advanced circuits (for electronics), processing unit (for electronics)

[x] - New item: Pig Iron Pellets
		Description: Used in the process of Advanced Steel Processing.
		
[] - New Building: Oxygen Plant
[]		item entry
		Description: Pulls atmospheric gases into a series of filters and compressors to extract Oxygen from the air.
[]		Recipe: electric engine unit (for compressor), iron plates (for the filters), pipes (for transporting the air), steel plates (for the structure), advanced circuits (for electronics), processing unit (for electronics)
	
[] - New Fluid/Gas: Oxygen Gas
		Description: Created in the Oxygen Plant. Used in the Oxygen Injected Furnace for making steel.

[] - New Building: Oxygen Injected Furnace
[]		item entry
		Description: Melts down Pig Iron Pellets into a furnace and injects pure Oxygen into the mixture to create molten steel, the steel is then cast into plates. One set of Pig Iron Pellets and 5 units of Oxygen will produce 1 steel plate.
[]		Recipe: Blast Furnace (for the furnace), storage tank (for the oxygen mixture storage), electric engine unit (for compressing and injecting the gas), steel plates (for structure)
