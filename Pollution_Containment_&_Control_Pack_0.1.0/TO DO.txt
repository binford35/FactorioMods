Pollution Containment & Control Pack
-------------------------------------
 - New Module: Pollution Capture 
	Description: PCC Module - Allows factories, chemical plants, oil refineries, etc. to capture pollution
	Recipe: microchips, pipes, storage tank, iron plates
 - New Item: Pollution Barrel
 - New Fluid/Gas: Pollution
 - New Item (building): Drilling Rig
	Description: Digs disposal well to store gas
				 Needs pipes and iron plates to keep drilling the well deeper, to allow for more gas storage
	Recipe: iron plates, pipes, steel
 - New Module: Active Charcoal Filtering
	Description: PCC Module
				 Adds two slots on the building for charcoal (Activated and Satiated)
				 Building will produce Satiated Charcoal once the Activated Charcoal is used up
				 This method will be somewhere around 95% effective
	Recipe: microchips, iron plates, pipes, storage tank
 - New Item (building): Charcoal Boiler
	Description: Uses charcoal to boil water, less pollution
	Recipe: pipes, iron plates, stone bricks
 - New Item (building): Charcoal Furnace
	Description: Furnace that makes charcoal from wood.
	Recipe: Stone bricks, Iron plates
 - New Item (building): Charcoal Reactivation Plant
	Description: Requires high energy usage and produces large amount of heat
	Recipe: storage tanks, iron plates, microchips, advanced microchips, copper plates, plastic
 - New Item (resource): Charcoal
	Description: Made from putting wood in charcoal boilers or furnaces
 - New Item: Activated Charcoal
	Description: Made from processing Charcoal in a Charcoal Reactivation Plant
 - New Item (building): Air Scrubber
	Description: Needs Activated Charcoal and Electricity, filters either the air around it or piped in air or barrels of pollution and cleans it at a certain rate
				 Satiated Charcoal and Pollution Waste is produced and will need to be removed (waste) periodically and reactivated (charcoal)
				 Recipe: pipes, iron plates: plastic, microchips, advanced microchips, copper plates
 - New item: Satiated Charcoal
	Description: Produced as a result of air scrubbing or buildings with the pollution control modules
 - New Module: Electrostatic Precipitator
	Description: PCC Module
				 Adds a slot on the building for an ESP to be installed
				 Adds a slot for waste produced by the ESP
				 This should be about 99% effective
				 Increases electricity use by 25%
	Recipe: Advanced microchips, blue chips, Iron plates, steel, accumulators, pipes
 - New Module: Baghouse
	Description: PCC Module
				 Only available to be used in electric furnaces
				 Adds a slot for synthetic materials in electric furnaces, which remove 99% of pollution
				 Synthetic Materials are slowly used up
				 Adds another slot for waste produced by the filter, this waste should be generated moderately to high
	Recipe: advanced microchips, iron plate, efficiency module, copper plate
 - New Item: Synthetic Materials
	Recipe: plastic, iron plate
 - New Item (building): Recycle Plant
	Description: Turns items back into components
				 Able to recycle: steel, iron, copper, plastics
				 Not able to recycle microchips
				 Will need two rows of slots for items recycled and for incoming items to be recycled
				 (?)Certain intermediate items will need to be processed more than once to get the more base components - ie. pipes, batteries, gears, etc
				 /or/ (?) produces unrefined piles of steel, iron, copper, and plastic which need to be sent to a furnace to be refined into the correct product.
	Recipe: microchips, advanced microchips, blue chips, plastic, express splitters, express conveyor belts, iron plates, steel, fast inserters, smart inserters)
 - New Item (building): Gas/Oil/Petroleum/Solid Fuel Generator
	Recipe: Electro-Magnets, steel, gears, iron plates, circuits, advanced circuits, engines
 - New Item: Electro-Magnets
 - New Technology: PCC (Pollution Containment & Control)
	- New Technology: Charcoal Filtering (also requires charcoal production)
       - New technology: Air Scrubbing
    - New technology: ESP (Electrostatic Precipitator)
    - New technology: BagHouse
    - New technology: Disposal Wells
 - New technology: Electro-Magnets (allows sorting of ferrous metals, in aid to the recycling plants; requirement for electric motors and generators, and recycling plants)
    - New technology: Recycling
 - New technology: Synthetic Material Processing
 - New technology: Charcoal Production
