Items:

[]  - New item (building): Material Milling Plant 
[]		item entry
		Description: mills iron, copper, steel, and plastic into powders for use in the 3d Manufacturing plant
[]		Recipe: stone bricks(5), iron plates(50), pipes(3), gears(5), steel(25), express conveyor belts(5)

[]  - New item: iron powder
		subgroup: intermediate-product

[]  - New item: copper powder
		subgroup: intermediate-product
		
[]  - New item: plastic spool
		subgroup: intermediate-product

[]  - New item: steel powder
		subgroup: intermediate-product
		
[]  - New item (building): Powder hopper
[]		item entry
		Description: similar to storage tanks, but hold powders instead of liquids
[]		Recipe: (Same as storage tanks)
		
[]  - New item (building): 3D Manufacturing plant
[]		item entry
		Description: Can build most items out of iron, copper, steel, and plastic; can't build anything that requires a chemical process without extra ingredients; 
					(?)May be able to build all prerequisite items within a factory and then build desired item
					(?)/or/ will just take as long as it would to build each subsequent item, plus the desired item.
					Manufacturing will be slower than the regular factories as each layer is built up slowly. Speed modules should help.
					Higher energy consumption vs normal factories.
[]		Recipe:
					
[]  - New item: pneumatic conveyance pipes
		Description: Will be faster than conveyor belts;
					 Should be slower, but similar to water/oil pipes
					 
[?] - New building: pneumatic air pump (optional)
		Description: adds pressure to lines so that each pneumatic line needs an airpump and blower in order to work.
		
[?] - New building: pneumatic blower package (optional)
		Description: blows pressured air from lines so that each pneumatic line needs an airpump and blower in order to work.
