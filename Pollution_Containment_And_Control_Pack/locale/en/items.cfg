[technology-description]
air_scubber = Allows creation of Air Scrubbers, for reducing pollution output of buildings.
baghouse = Allows the creation of Baghouses, which pull pollution particles out of the air from furnaces to reduce their pollution output.
charcoal_filter = Allows the creation of Activated Charcoal, which is used in Air Scrubbers to reduce pollution released into the environment.
charcoal_production = Allows Charcoal Kilns, which produce charcoal for various filtering processes as well as reactivation of Satiated Charcoal.
disposal_well = Allows the building of Disposal Wells, which can be used to process unwanted liquids, gasses, and pollution.
electro-static_precipitator = Allows building of the ESP (Electro-static Precipitator) Module, which uses electricity to pull pollution out of the air systems of assembly plants.
recycling = Allows the building of Automated Recycling plants which can break down unwanted items into their base components: Iron Plates, Steel Plates, Copper Plates, and Plastic.
synthetic_materials = Allows the building of synthetic materials which are used as filters in Air Scrubbers and Baghouses.
