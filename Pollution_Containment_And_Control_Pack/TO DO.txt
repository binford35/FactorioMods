Pollution Containment & Control Pack
-------------------------------------

Items:
[]  - New Module: Pollution Capture 
		Description: PCC Module - Allows factories, chemical plants, oil refineries, etc. to capture pollution
[x]		Recipe: microchips, pipes, storage tank, iron plates
 
[]  - New Item: Pollution Barrel
 
[]  - New Fluid/Gas: Pollution

[]  - New Item (building): Drilling Rig
[]		item entry
		Description: Digs disposal well to store gas; Needs pipes and iron plates to keep drilling the well deeper, to allow for more gas storage
[x]		Recipe: iron plates, pipes, steel
 
[]  - New Module: Active Charcoal Filtering
		Description: PCC Module; Adds two slots on the building for charcoal (Activated and Satiated); Building will produce Satiated Charcoal once the Activated Charcoal is used up; This method will be somewhere around 95% effective
[x]		Recipe: microchips, iron plates, pipes, storage tank

[?] - New Item (building): Charcoal Boiler				??? Do we need a separate building? The idea was to have it produce less pollution ???
[]		item entry
		Description: Uses charcoal to boil water, less pollution
[?]		Recipe: pipes, iron plates, stone bricks

[]  - New Item (building): Charcoal Furnace
[]  	item entry
		Description: Furnace that makes charcoal from wood.
[x]		Recipe: Stone bricks, Iron plates

[]  - New Item (building): Charcoal Reactivation Plant
[]		item entry
		Description: Requires high energy usage and produces large amount of heat
[x]		Recipe: storage tanks, iron plates, microchips, advanced microchips
 
[]  - New Item (resource): Charcoal
		Description: Made from putting wood in charcoal boilers or furnaces

[]  - New Item: Activated Charcoal
		Description: Made from processing Charcoal in a Charcoal Reactivation Plant

[]  - New Item (building): Air Scrubber
		Description: Needs Activated Charcoal and Electricity, filters either the air around it or piped in air or barrels of pollution and cleans it at a certain rate; Satiated Charcoal and Pollution Waste is produced and will need to be removed (waste) periodically and reactivated (charcoal)
[x]		Recipe: pipes, iron plates: plastic, microchips, advanced microchips, copper plates
 
[]  - New item: Satiated Charcoal
		Description: Produced as a result of air scrubbing or buildings with the pollution control modules
		
[]  - New Module: Electrostatic Precipitator
		Description: PCC Module; Adds a slot on the building for an ESP to be installed; Adds a slot for waste produced by the ESP; This should be about 99% effective; Increases electricity use by 25%
[x]		Recipe: Advanced microchips, blue chips, Iron plates, steel, accumulators, pipes
 
[]  - New Module: Baghouse
		Description: PCC Module; Only available to be used in electric furnaces; Adds a slot for synthetic materials in electric furnaces, which remove 99% of pollution; Synthetic Materials are slowly used up; Adds another slot for waste produced by the filter, this waste should be generated moderately to high
[x]		Recipe: advanced microchips, iron plate, efficiency module, copper plate

[x] - New Item: Synthetic Material
[x] 	Recipe: plastic

[]  - New Item (building): Recycling Plant
[]		item entry
		Description: Turns items back into components; Able to recycle: steel, iron, copper, plastics; Not able to recycle microchips; Will need two rows of slots for items recycled and for incoming items to be recycled; (?)Certain intermediate items will need to be processed more than once to get the more base components - ie. pipes, batteries, gears, etc
				 /or/ (?) produces unrefined piles of steel, iron, copper, and plastic which need to be sent to a furnace to be refined into the correct product.
[x]		Recipe: microchips, advanced microchips, blue chips, plastic, express splitters, express conveyor belts, iron plates, steel, fast inserters, smart inserters)
 
[]  - New Item (building): Gas/Oil/Petroleum/Solid Fuel Generator
[]		item entry
		Description: Generates electricity from any fuel
[x]		Recipe: Electro-Magnets, steel, gears, iron plates, circuits, advanced circuits, engines

[x] - New Item: Electro-Magnets
