3D Printing Pack
-------------------------------------

- New technology: 3D printing (requires lasers)
- New item (building): Material Milling Plant 
	Description: mills iron, copper, steel, and plastic into powders for use in the 3d Manufacturing plant
	Recipe: stone bricks(5), iron plates(50), pipes(3), gears(5), steel(25), express conveyor belts(5)
- New item: iron powder
	subgroup: intermediate-product
- New item: copper powder
	subgroup: intermediate-product
- New item: plastic powder
	subgroup: intermediate-product
- New item (building): Powder hopper
	Description: similar to storage tanks, but hold powders instead of liquids
- New item: powder conveyer belt
- New item: fast powder conveyer belt
- New item: express powder conveyer belt
- New item (building): 3D Manufacturing plant
	Description: Can build most items out of iron, copper, steel, and plastic; can't build anything that requires a chemical process without extra ingredients; 
				 (?)May be able to build all prerequisite items within a factory and then build desired item
				 (?)/or/ will just take as long as it would to build each subsequent item, plus the desired item.
				 Manufacturing will be slower than the regular factories as each layer is built up slowly. Speed modules should help.
				 Higher energy consumption vs normal factories.
- New Technology: Pneumatic vacuum conveying systems
	Description: allows building of pneumatic transport of powders
- New item: pneumatic conveyance pipes
	Description: Will be faster than conveyor belts;
				 Should be slower, but similar to water/oil pipes
- (?)New building: pneumatic air pump (optional)
	Description: adds pressure to lines so that each pneumatic line needs an airpump and blower in order to work.
- (?)New building: pneumatic blower package (optional)
    Description: blows pressured air from lines so that each pneumatic line needs an airpump and blower in order to work.
